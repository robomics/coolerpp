# Coolerpp: High-performance C++ library to read and write .cool files

[![Unit tests Ubuntu](https://github.com/robomics/coolerpp/actions/workflows/unit-tests-ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/robomics/coolerpp/actions/workflows/unit-tests-ubuntu.yml)

This library is currently work-in-progress, completely lacks documentation and its API is subject to change.

Use at your own risk :).
